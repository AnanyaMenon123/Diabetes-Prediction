# Diabetes-Prediction

We predict if for a given observation , the patient has diabetes or not. 
1 represents if the patient is diabeteic, 0 represents that the patient is non-diabetic.
A Support Vector Machine model is used by the Support Vector classifier module.
The actual results versus the predicted results are compared, and the model does this comparison with around 81% accuracy, after standardizing and splitting the data into training and testing data.
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle contains Pregnancies, Glucose, skin thickness and various other factors as columns.
